          All Trust Master Providers are required to carry general liability insurance. Minnesota
          law requires businesses and contractors who have been issued licenses by the Minnesota
          Department of Labor & Industry (DLI) to have and maintain general liability insurance
          coverage for their license to be valid. This means the business or contractor must have a
          general liability insurance policy in effect when a license is issued and maintain
          continuous liability insurance coverage throughout the license period.

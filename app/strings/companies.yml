          All Trust Master Providers are required to carry general liability insurance. Minnesota
          law requires businesses and contractors who have been issued licenses by the Minnesota
          Department of Labor & Industry (DLI) to have and maintain general liability insurance
          coverage for their license to be valid. This means the business or contractor must have a
          general liability insurance policy in effect when a license is issued and maintain
          continuous liability insurance coverage throughout the license period.

            All Providers who are licensed through the Minnesota Department of Labor & Industry
            (DLI) are required to carry general liability insurance.  This enables us to provide
            "trusted exclusivity" by encouraging authenticity and ensuring the most accurate and up

          what_is_this?: >

            Minnesota law requires businesses and contractors who have been issued licenses by the
            Minnesota Department of Labor & Industry (DLI) to "have and maintain" general liability
            insurance coverage for their license to be valid. This means any licensed business or
            contractor failing to keep their liability insurance coverage in effect is immediately
            presumed to be unlicensed and, as such, prohibited from acting or holding themselves out
            as a licensed business or contractor

          instructions: >

            All Providers who require licensing or bonding to lawfully do business in Minnesota are
            required to validate their licensing credentials through the Minnesota Department of
            Labor & Industry (DLI). This enables us to provide "trusted exclusivity" by encouraging
            authenticity and ensuring the most accurate and up to date Minnesota license status.

          what_is_this?: >

            The Minnesota Department of Labor & Industry (DLI) is the agency responsible for
            licensing residential building contractors. DLI also licenses roofers and manufactured
            home installers as well as plumbers and electrical contractors. In accordance with the
            Minnesota DLI licensing guidelines, Trust Master requires all service providers who
            perform a residential licensed trade or residential building or remodeling services to
            maintain their state of Minnesota licensing requirements.


            A contractor who fulfills their licensing obligation to operate in Minnesota ensures the
            contractor has met certain requirements, including having a principal of the company
            pass an appropriate examination and having liability and property damage insurance. A
            licensed contractor must also take a number of continuing education classes each year.


            Hiring a licensed contractor also provides access to the Contractor Recovery Fund which
            reimburses consumers who suffer financial losses as a result of a licensed contractorâ€™s
            misconduct. The Fund compensates owners or lessees of residential property in Minnesota
            who have suffered an actual and direct out-of-pocket loss due to a licensed contractor's
            fraudulent, deceptive or dishonest practices, conversion of funds or failure of
            performance.
